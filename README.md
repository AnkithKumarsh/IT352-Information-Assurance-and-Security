# Primitive Root Calculator

## Overview
The **Primitive Root Calculator** is a web-based application designed for the **IT352 - Information Assurance and Security** course at the **National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal**. This tool allows users to find and verify primitive roots in modular arithmetic.

## Features
- üßÆ **Find Primitive Roots**: Compute all primitive roots for a given positive integer.
- üîç **Check a Number**: Verify whether a specific number is a primitive root modulo *n*.
- üåó **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes for a better user experience.
- üìú **Calculation History**: View and track recent calculations.
- üì§ **Export Options**:
  - Export primitive roots as a CSV file.
  - Save calculation steps as a text file.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Core Algorithms**: Implemented using TypeScript for modular arithmetic computations

## Mathematical Background
A primitive root modulo n is an integer a such that for any integer coprime to n, there exists some integer k such that a^k ‚â° 1 (mod n).

The calculator makes use of the following key mathematical functions:
- **Euler's Totient Function (œÜ(n))**: Computes the count of numbers less than *n* that are coprime to *n*.
- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Determines whether two numbers are coprime.
- **Modular Exponentiation**: Efficiently computes large modular powers.
